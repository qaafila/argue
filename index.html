            <h2>The Million-Dollar Decision</h2>
            <p>Imagine this: You're the CEO of a struggling tech startup. Your company has developed a groundbreaking AI algorithm that could revolutionize healthcare diagnosis. But there's a catch...</p>
            <p>Your lead developer, Sarah, claims she discovered a critical flaw in the algorithm just days before the big product launch. She argues that rolling out the product now could lead to misdiagnoses and potentially harm patients. However, your marketing team insists that any delay would bankrupt the company, leaving 100 employees jobless and crushing your dreams of making healthcare more accessible.</p>
            <p>Now, you have mere hours to make a decision that could impact millions of lives and the future of your company.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you trust Sarah's claim about the flaw? What evidence would you need to see?</li>
                <li>How do you weigh the potential risks against the benefits?</li>
                <li>Can you spot any biases or logical fallacies in the arguments presented?</li>
            </ul>

In this course, you'll learn how to dissect arguments, build compelling cases, and navigate complex ethical dilemmas like this one.</p>
